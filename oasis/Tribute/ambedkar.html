    <p>Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, popularly known as Babasaheb, was an Indian jurist, economist, politician, and social reformer who inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement and campaigned against social discrimination towards the untouchables (Dalits), while also supporting the rights of women and workers.</p>
    <p>Born into a poor Mahar (Dalit) family, Ambedkar faced social discrimination from an early age. However, his determination to fight against injustice led him to become one of the most influential figures in Indian history. He played a pivotal role in drafting the Indian Constitution and is often referred to as the "Father of the Indian Constitution."</p>
